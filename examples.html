<h2>Examples of splitHTML in use:</h2>

	<p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <b>Lorem <i>Ipsum</i></b> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
