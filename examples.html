<h2>Examples of splitHTML in use:</h2>
<div id="intro"> 
<h1> Intro, as well as an example (try hovering!)</h1>
Everything you see below was once regular HTML, written without any excessive use of elements and quite readable if one were to look at the source code. SplitHTML has split the plaintext content into fragments(letters/words) in each of the elements below and encapsulated them in new elements. The colors/waves/etc are added just to show what can be done by changing each of the new elements' properties, giving them a unique value. It can also, although I couldn't figure a good way to display it here, give you the computed position, size, etc of a selected fragment.<br/><br/><b>And now, for something <i>completely<sup>2</sup></i> different...</b> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
